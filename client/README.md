# **About** :

This is the front-end React part for the complete RecYippee site 

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The app is ready to be deployed!

### `Deployment`
I personally use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to deploy my React apps.\
It's so simple to use :
+ run `npm build`
+ This creates a `build` folder in your workspace
+ Just drag and drop this folder to netlify
+ Your react app will be deployed by now and you can change the URL as you wish!
